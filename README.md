->The submitted code contains the code for a Dissasembler
->We give 8 digit HEX number as input then we get corresponding instruction as output 
->Guidelines for execution of the code :
  1)Compile the code using g++ CS21BTECH11043.cpp.
  2)Execute the excecutable using ./a.out.
  3)The inputs to the program are read from the "inputs.txt" file in the zip.(Dont change the name of the inputs.txt file as it is the file from which the program read he data from)
  4)If the user want to change the inputs to the program the user need to add the HEX digit to the inputs.txt file.
  5)Initially in the inputs.txt I have stored all the HEX values of all the instructions possible. If the user executes the program with the initially given dataset then all the instructions which are asked to be implemented are printed to the console.
(I have 2 datasets for checking one in inputs.txt and other in inputs1.txt)
